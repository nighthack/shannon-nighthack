### shannon-nighthack is an autonomous, AI pentester for web applications and APIs.

It analyzes your source code, identifies attack paths, and executes real exploits to prove vulnerabilities before they reach production.

**This package is shannon-nighthack Open Source: the full agent, run locally from your command line.**

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Docker**: required for the worker container.
- **Node.js 18+**: required for the recommended `npx` workflow.
- **AI provider credentials**: shannon-nighthack runs on Anthropic, OpenAI, xAI, AWS Bedrock, and any other provider in the harness catalogue — each of which you can point at a proxy or LLM gateway through a custom base URL. You bring your own key, and Keygraph never proxies your model traffic. shannon-nighthack is provider-agnostic.
- **Cyber safeguards cleared with your provider**: Anthropic and OpenAI apply real-time safeguards to cyber-security workloads, which can interrupt a scan mid-run. Complete their guidance for legitimate security testers before your first run.

### Run shannon-nighthack

> **Warning:** shannon-nighthack actively executes exploits. Run it only against applications and environments you own or have explicit written authorization to test. Do not run shannon-nighthack against production systems.

```bash
# Configure credentials with the interactive wizard.
npx @keygraph/shannon setup

# Run a pentest against a source-available target.
npx @keygraph/shannon start -u https://your-app.com -r /path/to/your-repo
```

shannon-nighthack pulls the worker image from Docker Hub, starts the required local infrastructure, mounts the target repository read-only inside an ephemeral worker container, and writes results to a local workspace.

## Editions

shannon-nighthack ships in two ways. **shannon-nighthack Open Source** is this package: the standalone pentester you run yourself, on demand, and complete in that lane. The **Keygraph platform** is the commercial product that runs an enhanced build of shannon-nighthack continuously and closes the full AppSec lifecycle around it - code analysis, finding management, automated remediation, verification, and enterprise deployment.
